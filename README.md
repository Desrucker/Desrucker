# Hi Mom! 👋

## 🌵 About Me

I'm a proud Sun Devil from [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/) 🌞🔱. Currently, working on my Applied Computing, with a focus on Cybersecurity.

## 🎓 Academic Journey

My journey at ASU has been amazing. Beyond the rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, it's the community of innovators, educators, and peers that truly makes the experience invaluable. Together, we are not only learning the intricacies of cybersecurity but also understanding its ethical implications and societal impacts.

## 💡 Interests

- **Ethical Hacking:** Exploring systems, finding vulnerabilities, and patching them up before the bad guys find them.
- **Pentesting:** Proactively testing systems to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
- **Anticheats:** Ensuring a fair playing field in the digital gaming world by preventing cheating mechanisms.

## 🎓 School Activities & Societies

While academic pursuits remain a pivotal part of my journey at ASU, engaging in extracurricular activities and being part of student societies has deeply enriched my university experience. Here's a glimpse into my active involvement:

### 🤝 **Black African Coalition**
As a proud member of the [Black African Coalition](https://eoss.asu.edu/clubs/BAC), I'm deeply invested in fostering unity among the African and African American students at ASU. Our coalition not only focuses on addressing the needs and concerns of the Black community but also serves as a powerful platform for cultural, educational, and social activities. Engaging with fellow members, organizing events, and voicing concerns have been transformative experiences.

### 🌐 **Black Student Union (DPC)**
Being an active member of the [Black Student Union at the Downtown Phoenix Campus (DPC)](https://eoss.asu.edu/clubs/BSU), I've had the privilege to be part of a community that champions the Black culture, history, and legacy. The union has been instrumental in promoting cultural understanding, bridging gaps, and fostering an inclusive environment. Through workshops, events, and outreach, we're making a positive impact on the student body and the larger community.
